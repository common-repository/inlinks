== Description ==

There had always been a scarcity of WP plugins that would perform simple tasks. Here we present InterLinking - a simple tool that helps you to link a specific keyword with respective URL throughout the blog. 

This will help when you want to emphasise on a few specific pages for specific terms. A simple example: set the keyword to 'Contact Us Now' and use the URL: yourdomain.com/contact-us/. Now every time you use the phrase 'Contact Us Now' - it will get linked to your contact page. 

More importantly, this plugin works well to link to external websites.

e.g.

1. Upload 'plugin-name.php' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
